      <h3>Build a Project Selection Filter</h3>
  
      <p>
      Use this page to build a project selection filter by setting project
      attribute values to the ones you are looking for, and date ranges to
      span the dates you are looking for. Filters for different attributes
      are AND'ed together, but multiple values for the same attribute (by
      pressing "Open for multiple selections") are OR'ed together. Date and
      number ranges are inclusive.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        {{filter.projectList.list.length}} projects selected
